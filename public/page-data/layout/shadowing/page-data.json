The file should have the same name as the file you’re shadowing.\n\nIn order to place your own title in the Header component:\n\n1. Create a file at the same directory as the component you wish to shadow. Everything after `src/gatsby-theme-Particle/`\n   refers to the [src directory of gatsby-theme-Particle](https://github.com/Particle-design-system/gatsby-theme-Particle/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-Particle/src).\n\n1. Import the component you wish to shadow by providing the full url pointing at the component within the theme\n\n1. Your component will **receive the same props** as the one you’re shadowing. You’ll can log those props to see if you’ll need any of them\n\n1. Regardless, you should _ALWAYS_ spread the extra props into the original component, this allows the core component to function as needed. Even if it doesn’t receive any props now, it might in the future.\n\n1. Provide your new, custom component as the default export\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Header from 'gatsby-theme-Particle/src/components/Header';\n\nconst ParticleHeader = props => (\n  <Header {...props}>\n    <span>Gatsby theme</span>&nbsp;Particle\n  </Header>\n);\n\nexport default ParticleHeader;\n```\n\n## Components you’ll need to shadow\n\nWe’ve already provided pre-shadowed, dummy components however these are the ones you’ll definitely need to shadow.\n\n| Component     | Path                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                        |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ResourceLinks | [`src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/LeftNav/ResourceLinks.js`](https://github.com/Particle-design-system/gatsby-theme-Particle/blob/master/packages/example/src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/LeftNav/ResourceLinks.js) | The bottom links on the SideNav, pass `shouldOpenNewTabs` to open links externally |\n| Footer        | [`src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/Footer.js`](https://github.com/Particle-design-system/gatsby-theme-Particle/blob/master/packages/example/src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/Footer.js)                               | The links and content at the bottom of each page                                   |\n| Header        | [`src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/Header.js`](https://github.com/Particle-design-system/gatsby-theme-Particle/blob/master/packages/example/src/gatsby-theme-Particle/components/Header.js)                               | The text in the top left corner of the UI Shell                                    |\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"12cb5a688da77d1577a21bcddda6944c","counter":147,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"exports":[],"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Shadowing\ndescription: Guide for shadowing theme components and files\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIn the world of Gatsby themes, [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) is an extremely powerful way for developers to provide their _own_ components for the theme to use over the defaults.
