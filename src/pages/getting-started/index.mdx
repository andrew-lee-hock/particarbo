This project is a [Gatsby theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) that empowers developers, writers, and designers to create fast, accessible sites.

## First steps

1. **Create your site** – use the gatsby CLI to bootstrap your site with the starter

   ```sh
   npx gatsby new my-new-site 
   ```

2. **Start developing** – navigate into your directory with `cd  my-new-site `.

   Start it up using one of the following snippets. You can tell which command to use based on the lock file at the root of your project (`yarn.lock` for yarn and `package-lock.json` for npm). For yarn, type `yarn dev` for npm, you’ll use `npm run dev`.

3. **Make some changes!** – open [localhost:8000](//localhost:8000) in your browser to see your site running.

   Each of the Items in your side bar correlates to a MDX file in your `src/pages/` directory. Navigate to a site and try editing the corresponding markdown file. You’ll be able to see it update live!
